note:
the image processing library JJIL is LGPLv3.  (which is included in binary form)
Gray8DetectHaarMultiScale.java is included in source code, as it was patched to return the list of rectangles. If this presents an issue for you
you can remove the face detection logic form app/controllers/ImageC.scala so it doesn't do face detection.
